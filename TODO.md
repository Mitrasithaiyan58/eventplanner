# TODO: Implement Event Manager Dashboard with AI Name Generator and Separate Event Creation

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Modify UserDashboard.jsx to fetch /events/available for "Available Events" instead of /events
- [x] Modify EventForm.jsx to set adminOrganizer if the creator is a manager (check localStorage for "eventManager")
- [x] Test event creation by managers and users
- [x] Verify available events show only manager-created ones
- [x] Ensure AI name generator works for both managers and users
